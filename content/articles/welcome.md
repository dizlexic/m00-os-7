# Welcome to m00-os-7

This project is a nostalgic journey back to the early 90s, recreating the experience of using **Macintosh System 7**.

## Project Goals

- **Visual Authenticity**: Every pixel should feel like it belongs in 1991.
- **Interactive Experience**: Drag-and-drop windows, functional menus, and classic apps.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Nuxt 3, Vue 3, and TypeScript.

## How to use

- Double-click icons on the desktop to open folders or apps.
- Use the menu bar at the top to access system functions.
- Empty the trash when you're done!

Stay tuned for more updates!
